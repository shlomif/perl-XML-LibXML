        [QUOTE]
        Updated how legacy parser local callbacks are utilized by
        init_callbacks so that the XML::LibXML::InputCallback object doesn't
        have to be temporarily modified during the parsing process.

        This change could break code for users that have subclassed
        XML::LibXML::InputCallback and overridden the init_callbacks method

     * general error reporting code cleanup/rewrite, try preventing
       possible memory leaks
     * recover(1) now triggers warnings (disable with $SIG{__WARN__}=sub {})
       (fixes bug 1968, too)
     * slighlty more strict parse_string behavior (now same as when
       parsing fh, etc): e.g. parse_string("<foo:bar>"), i.e prefix without
       NS declaration, raises error unless recover(1) is used
     * documentation fixes/updates
     * slightly updated test set to reflect the new slightly more strict
       parsing.
