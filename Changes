        [QUOTE]
        Updated how legacy parser local callbacks are utilized by
        init_callbacks so that the XML::LibXML::InputCallback object doesn't
        have to be temporarily modified during the parsing process.

        This change could break code for users that have subclassed
        XML::LibXML::InputCallback and overridden the init_callbacks method

   - documentation fixes
   - better namespace reconciliation implemented by Tim Brody

   - make {get,set,has}Attribute(Node)? methods work with full
     attribute names rather than just localnames.
     (Although DOM Level 3 is not very clear about the behavior of
     these methods for an attributes with namespaces, it certainly
     does not imply that getAttribute('foo') should return value of a
     bar:foo, which was the old behavior.)

   - added XML Schema validation interface (XML::LibXML::Schema)
   - added XML RelaxNG validation interface (XML::LibXML::RelaxNG)
   - Michael K. Edwards' patch applied with some amendments from Petr Pajas:
     * add debian build files (I added SKIP_SAX_INSTALL flag for
       Makefile.PL and changed the patch so that it doesn't disable
       sax parser registration completely by default, and rather made
       debian build use this flag)
     * general cleanup (use SV_nolen, etc.)
     * SAX parsers cleanup
     * general error reporting code cleanup/rewrite, try preventing
       possible memory leaks
     * recover(1) now triggers warnings (disable with $SIG{__WARN__}=sub {})
       (fixes bug 1968, too)
     * slighlty more strict parse_string behavior (now same as when
       parsing fh, etc): e.g. parse_string("<foo:bar>"), i.e prefix without
       NS declaration, raises error unless recover(1) is used
     * documentation fixes/updates
     * slightly updated test set to reflect the new slightly more strict
       parsing.
   - fixed default c14n XPath to include attributes and namespaces (Petr Pajas)
   - make libxml2's xmlXPathOrderDocElems available through a new

   Parser
   - catalog interface
   - enabled SGML parsing
   - implemented libxml2 dom recovering
   - parsing into GDOME nodes is now possible

   DOM interface
   - Node Iterator class

   major fixes:
   - possible buffer overflow with broken XML:
     This may effect all older versions of XML::LibXML, please upgrade!

   - very stupid encoding bug. all UTF8 strings will now be marked as
     UTF8 correctly

     the namespaces of the document element will always be added now
